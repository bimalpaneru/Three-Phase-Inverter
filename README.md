# Three-Phase-Inverter
This is the simulink model for a grid forming inverter. Thus, the model is for operation in islanded mode. The design is implemented using SPWM and a LC filter. Typical PI controller scheme is used to control the voltage and current of the inverter. The RL Wey connected load is assumed to consume 10kW power at 0.95 power factor.
